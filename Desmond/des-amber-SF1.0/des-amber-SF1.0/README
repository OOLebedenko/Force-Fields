# v4:
# Modified THR and SER side-chains based on Kirkwood-Buff integrals for Ethanol
# Modified Arg parameters based on protein-RNA simulations
# v5:
# cleaned up charges for zwitterionic and temrinal residues.
# met
# Applied Joung and Cheatham param,eters for Na, K and Cl.  Reverted Met non-bonded parameters to standard Amber99SB.
#
#met3
# Reduced radius of K and Cl by 0.1 A
# Made radius of charged amine the same as K

#met4
# Rescaled epsilon of O2 by 1/10 (0.21 -> 0.02) and rescaled sigma to 3.6 to keep C12 constant

#ch1.0_met4
# rescaled charges on ions to 1.0.  Kept charges of zwitterions.

#ch1.0_met4
# Increased N3 sigma by 0.1 

#ch1.0_met7
# Moved 0.2 units of charge from CD to NZ in LYS and 0.3 units of charge from CZ to N in ARG

#ch1.0_met8
# Moved 0.1 units of charge from CD to NZ in LYS.  Reduced sigma of NR by 0.1 A             

#ch1.0_met9
# Moved 0.1 units of charge from CG to NZ in LYS.  Reduced sigma of NR by 0.05 A.  Moved -0.2 unites of charge from C to CA of ALA2             

#ch1.0_met10
# Moved -0.1 units of charge from C to CA of ALA2. Moved 0.3 units of charge from CZ to the Nitrogen atoms of ARG.

#ch1.0_met11
# decreased sigma of Na+ by 0.1 and increased sigma of Cl- by 0.1

#ch1.0_met12
# increased sigma of Cl- by 0.1

#ch1.0_met13
# Increased N3 sigma by 0.2 

#ch1.0_met14
# decreased sigma of Cl- by 0.3

#ch1.0_met15
# decreased sigma of O2 by 0.1; increased sigma of N3 by 0.05

#ch1.0_met16
# decreased sigma of N3 and NR by 0.05

#ch1.0_met17
# Increased sigma of K and O2 by 0.05; moved 0.1 units of charge from CG of ARG to CZ and HE

#ch1.0_met18
# Increased of O2 by 0.05 (same as met14)
# Introduced specific Mg-Owat pair tuned to reproduce RDF and affinity for negatively charged groups
# Parametrized MG sigma using tRNA simulations.  The result is suboptimal, but it is as good as it gets.
